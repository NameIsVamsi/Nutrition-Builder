        <h2>Food facts are not something you really think about when eating your favorite meal, but we do!

Food can either be a nutritious meal or a guilty pleasure! We all have our weaknesses when it comes to what we like to eat.
Some of those foods, whether they’re healthy or not, have interesting facts about them that you never would have guessed or thought of.
For example, did you know that ranch dressing is dyed? You’d be surprised to find out what it’s dyed with!</h2>

  <h2><li><u>Ketchup used to be used as a medicine.</u></li></h2>
  <p><h2>Back in the early 1800’s, people thought tomatoes had medicinal qualities.
    

    One doctor claimed they could treat diarrhea and indigestion, so he made a recipe for a type of tomato ketchup which then became a pill.</h2></p>

    <h2> <li><u>White chocolate isn’t chocolate.</u></li></h2>
    <p>I<h2>Its name is deceiving, because white chocolate doesn’t have any components of regular chocolate.

        It’s really just a mixture of sugar, milk, vanilla, lecithin, and cocoa butter.</h2></p>

    <h2> <li><u> Peppers don’t actually burn your mouth.</u></li></h2>
    <p>I<h2>There’s a chemical in chili peppers called capsaicin that tricks your mouth to feeling like it’s being burned – that’s why spicy food hurts.

        The pain is all in your head!</h2></p>

            <h2> <li> <u>Chocolate has been used as a currency in Ancient civilizations of Mexico and South America.</u></li></h2>
            <p>I<h2>As the Aztecs started dominating Mesoamerica, they also loved cocoa beans which couldn’t be grown in their civilization.

                They had to rely on the Mayans, and traded cocoa beans with them as a system of money.
                
                Chocolate isn’t the weirdest thing that’s been used as currency in the past either… potato mashers?</h2></p>
